# Silent-Bid-Auction
Silent Bid Auction program while using the OS python module. 
1) It uses the os module to clear the screen, providing a fresh view for each new bid.
2) It stores the name of each bidder and the amount theyâ€™ve bid.
3) It keeps the bids secret, not revealing previous bids to new bidders.
4) At the end of the auction, it provides a winning message, presumably to the highest bidder.
